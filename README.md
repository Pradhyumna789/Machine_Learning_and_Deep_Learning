# Machine_Learning
This repository is created with an intent to help anyone learn machine learning from scratch.

Start off learning and getting comfortable with Python libraries - Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib which are used extensively in Machine Learning.

Introduction follows with an intro to loading a sample dataset from scikit learn and making sense of it.
