# Machine_Learning
This repository is created with an intent to help anyone learn machine learning from scratch.

1. Start off learning and getting comfortable with Python libraries - Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib which are used extensively in Machine Learning.

2. Introduction follows with an intro to loading a sample dataset from scikit learn and making sense of it.

3. Learn Linear Regression.

4. Do a small project by implementing Linear Regression on a dummy sklearn dataset.

5. Learn multivariable regression and implement it on an imported dummy sklearn dataset.

6. Code the Gradient-Descent-Optimization-Algorithm for N features - (Generic Gradient Descent).
