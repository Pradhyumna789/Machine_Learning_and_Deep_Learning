# Machine_Learning
This repository is created with an intent to help anyone learn Machine-Learning and Deep-Learning from scratch.

*** The (Detailed Notes for every topic) directory contains content in detail for every concept. Make sure to check it out to understand any concept in detail.

Order of topics:
- Linear Regression
- Multivariable Regression and Gradient Descent
- Feature Scaling
- Logistic Regression
- Classification Measures
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- SVM
- PCA
- NLP
- Neural Networks
- Tensor Flow

- Unsupervised Learning



1. Start off learning and getting comfortable with Python libraries - Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib which are used extensively in Machine Learning.

2. Introduction follows with an intro to loading a sample dataset from scikit learn and making sense of it.

3. Learn Linear Regression.

4. Implement Linear Regression on a dummy sklearn dataset.

5. Learn multivariable regression and implement it on an imported dummy sklearn dataset.

6. Code the Gradient-Descent-Optimization-Algorithm for N features - (Generic Gradient Descent).

7. Code Logistic Regression from scratch and implement on two dummy datasets:
    Binary classification logistic regression - breast cancer dataset
    multi_class logistic regression - iris dataset
    
8. Classification Measures - These are used to test the performance of classification algorithms just like we used the cost function to test the performance of regression algorithms - Now let's quickly look at confusion matrix by applying Logistic Regression on the iris dataset.
